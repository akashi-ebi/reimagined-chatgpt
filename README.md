Jailbreaking prompts for use with OpenAI's ChatGPT model.
#### We do not condone using these prompts for malicious purposes. Educational use only.  

## Will I get banned for using these prompts?
Most likely not. However, this is against OpenAI's policy and is bannable. Evidently, I haven't seen anyone get banned from using similar prompts. 100% use at your own risk.

I also recommend using the unofficial desktop app, as it provides more functionality. https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT
